# dETH - ERC20 Reflection Token

$dETH, or Degen ETH, is a reflection token that rewards its holders in ETH, directly deposited into their wallets on the Optimism Network. It does this by enabling a transfer fee tax which is allocated in three different ways:
    -   Auto LP Allocation
    -   Reflections
    -   Marketing

The token allows developers to create auto burning LP mechanisms, reward their holders passively through the volume generated by the ERC20, and collect earnings themselves. 

## Why Reflections?

Reflections allow an easy entrypoint into any DeFi ecosystem by allowing holders to be rewarded with "yield" generated from token buys/sells. Because ETH is deposited directly into each holders wallets, all they have to do is purchase the token to participate. There is no LP'ing, staking, or any other step for the user to take in order to begin accumulating rewards. Simply purchase and hold dETH in your wallet, and you are eligible for dividends automatically paid out by the dETH token and its accompanying contracts
